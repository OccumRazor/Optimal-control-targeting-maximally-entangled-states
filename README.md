Some optimization examples are available in 'opt_examples/', to reproduce the result, run XN_optimization.py.


A rudimentary test of the speedup and accuracy of rotating wave approxiamtion (RWA)) is provided in RWA_Comparison.py,

above all, the t_step for both RWA and non-RWA case are not optimal.


At the moment a detailed tutorial is not provided.
