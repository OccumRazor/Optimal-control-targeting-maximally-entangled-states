This project is not finushed, and most of the content will be moved to another repository later to improve readability of this project.

At the moment only the code required to produce the data is provided, not the data.

Required Python packages:

matplotlib         3.9.2
numpy               1.26.4
qdyn                   23.4
qutip                  4.7.6
scipy                   1.12.0


To draw Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 5, run draw_all.py. The corresponding data are stored under directory 'data/'. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 will be appended later.
